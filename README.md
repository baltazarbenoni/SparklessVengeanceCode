# SparklessVengeanceCode
Code from a game project created in spring 2024.

During May and June of 2024 we created a 2D-game as a school project. The game in question side-scroller where the main character, a wizard who has lost his powers, advances through the level, administering vengeance upon those responsible for his situation. Our group was made up of three artists/graphic designers and two programmers. Our programming tasks were divided so that Veeti was responsible for all animation-related code and Daniel for game-mechanics and other aspects of the game. Having composed and recorded the music for the game, Daniel also built audio into the project.
The project remains unfinished. Towards the end of the second level, the player is supposed to encounter a 'final boss'. The art for this character has been done, but not imported into the game. Also, the code governing the behaviour of the boss-character has not been written. In general there is some bug-fixing to be done too. I intend to complete these tasks as soon as my other responsibilities allow for it.
Nevertheless, the game is playable.
